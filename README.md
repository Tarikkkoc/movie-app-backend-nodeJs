<h2>MOVIE APP BACKEND - NODE.JS</h2>
<p>
The project focuses on the backend aspect and employs Express.js for this purpose. Within the project, there are files named Users.json, Movies.json, Series.json, and Musics.json. Each of these files can be accessed through specific URLs. For instance, the Users.json file is accessible via "localhost:5000/users". The data coming from the frontend is in the object format, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are performed using this data. Additionally, Nodemon is utilized when deploying the project.
